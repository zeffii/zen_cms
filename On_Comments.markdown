## On Comments

This article will first discuss comments in a language agnostic way, subsequent sections will detail language specific style and syntax.

### What are comments?

That's a fair question. In most languages a comment is a line of human readable information that doesn't interact with the program it appears in. Comments serve to document parts of a program and can describe functions, routines, data structures and design decisions. Comments are usually a good thing, but not always. Let's get the negativity out of the way first! 

### Not all comments are useful. 

Here are some examples of _avoidable_ comments.
- example: stating the obvious (content)
- example: does not make sense (content)
- example: does not relate to nearby code (context)
- example: seems to relate to code that has since been removed (context)
- example: the todo. if you include one add the date it was added. - fix your todos first!

### What are they good for?

Commenting is a strategy we use to convey quickly in words those things that we think are not obvious from the code alone. Any coder who starts to enjoy coding will realize that there are ways to make life for his future self (and others) easier, commenting can be one of those ways. Commenting, however, is not a substitute for writing clear code.

Comments can facilitate the comprehension speed for people reading a piece of code for the first time, but the comment must be smart. Let a comment describe the idea behind the code more than the workings of the code.

> Initially coders learn new syntax and place remarks about what a line of code does, this is ok to do  - but eventually you will stop restating these tricks in your (native) tongue and trust that the code speaks for itself.

### Comments are like dress code sometimes

Depending on the environment your code lives in you might have to dress it up in formal attire. The company or open source project you work with has probably settled on a [programming style guide] which includes a section on how to format comments - it is important to align yourself with the prevailing style to make your contributions fit with the existing code base.

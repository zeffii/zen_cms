## On Naming

This article will discuss the concepts to consider when deciding on names for any part of your applications. Naming conventions trickle down into all parts of your programs. Deciding on good names for your files, functions, variables and classes is critical to making your life as a programmer easier. I want to cover a few conventions that are language agnostic, then further sections will touch specific languages.

### Anarchy becomes a ghost town

No matter what language you write (English, German.. JavaScript, Python) for you to be able to communicate effectively you must follow a set of rules. In programming languages there are syntax rules which are the _language specific_ rules that must be followed for a program to work, but there are _soft-implementation_ rules that help make it easier for humans to write and communicate code.

#### Soft Rules

Soft rules aren't usually part of the formal specification of a language, but as languages gain popularity we often see certain styles emerge. Styles cover topics such as (but not limited to): Naming, Formatting, Order and Commenting.

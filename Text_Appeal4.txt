Blender
=========

The Blender directory contains several full addons and part scripts.

  - Mesh Editing
  - Tile Rendering (Monster Tile Renderer)
  - Text Editor addons

The difference between an addon and a script is mostly the addition of boilerplate code to make the addon show up in the addon loader in user-preferences.

I've written a tonne of Blender scripts but this repo focusses only on those that i frequently return to to steal code from, or *actually* use a lot.  


Installing Addons is easy.
-----------

To install an Addon properly:

1. Inside `blender/../scripts/` plonk the content of addons_contrib
2. In `User Preferences -> addons -> all` look for the addon name and tick it
3. You don't need to install addons permanently, it's probably a good idea not to
4. If you find yourself using an addon a lot, then certainly configure blender to include it permanently
5. Permanent installation I do using `ctrl+U` after enabling an addon right from a default start.blend file.
6. There are other ways, so use those if you are more comfortable


Running non Addon scripts
--------------

One way to run scripts that aren't equipped with the addon boilerplate is to simply open them in the text editor and press `ctrl+p` or the run button.
There is some convenience to this method: you can save the script with the .blend and the script will travel with it. The downside is that the script
does travel with the .blend and can be a source of confusion to a recipient. Generally a short description of the script at the very top using docstring 
style quotes will ease the blocking points.

and more code here


    def func_majeur():
        island = 4
        coney = island
        return

    func majeur()


but it should allow script too..

<pre class="prettyprint lang-python">

$(document).ready(function() {  

    for( project_id in script_table){
        var project_name = project_id.replace(/_/g,' ');
        $('#my_menu').append('<li id=\"' + project_id + '\">' + project_name +'</li>');

        $('#'+ project_id).bind('click', function(e) {
            var a = $(this).attr('id');
            var location = script_table[a];
            $('#project').empty();

            var content = read_content(location);
            $('#project').append(content);
            console.log(a);
        });

    }

});
